title: Week 25 - First metrics obtained
---

After introducing ROS I started working on getting the first results using datasets with the application. To do this some hotfixes were done including the log of the first and last frame of a processed video (which were failing before) and the rescale of the detections for the log according to the resize done to the image. The MOT dataset ground truth was parsed and some tests were performed using train sequences from this dataset. The results obtained in terms of mAP were very poor so I think that some trouble is happening when using the metrics tool or maybe I made some mistake in the creation of the files for detections/ground truth.

Furthermore I continued to work on the writing of the dissertation introducing the state-of-the-art in tracking datasets.
