title: Week 18 - Offline mode and close
---

Last week I solved some small pending tasks. I have refactorized the offline mode to adapt it to the new architecture of the Network side. This mode was working at the very beginning of the project to allow the user to have an option of running the program without GUI. This way, you can save the results of the application as .jpg images. Apart from that, now the GUI can be fully closed by clicking the Close button. In the previous versions, the program was still running in background and it was necessary to close it in the terminal.

The last version is available at [https://github.com/RoboticsURJC-students/2017-tfm-alexandre-rodriguez/tree/develop/dl_objecttracker](https://github.com/RoboticsURJC-students/2017-tfm-alexandre-rodriguez/tree/develop/dl_objecttracker). The component was renamed from dl_objectsegmentator to dl_objecttracker.
