title: Week 4 - State of the Art work
---

This Christmas holidays I wrote an small part of the TFM report which includes the sections of introduction and State of the Art / Related works. In this document I talk about robotics in Computer Vision, neural networks, methods of tracking, detection and instance segmentation like Mask R-CNN, among other topics. The document is available at my GitHub repository [https://github.com/RoboticsURJC-students/2017-tfm-alexandre-rodriguez/blob/master/latex/Estado_del_Arte_INVESTIGACION_Alexandre_Rodriguez_Rendo.pdf](https://github.com/RoboticsURJC-students/2017-tfm-alexandre-rodriguez/blob/master/latex/Estado_del_Arte_INVESTIGACION_Alexandre_Rodriguez_Rendo.pdf)
