title: Week 1: getting started
---

In this first week, I started installing the JdeRobot environment on my laptop following the steps provided in [http://jderobot.org/Installation#From_Debian_packages](http://jderobot.org/Installation#From_Debian_packages). After that, I tested that my installation was working fine by playing with some examples provided in the Documentation section. For example, the OpenCV demo ([http://jderobot.org/index.php/Examples#Cameraserver_.2B_Opencvdemo](http://jderobot.org/index.php/Examples#Cameraserver_.2B_Opencvdemo)). If you want to use this example, you have to open two terminals and type on each one the following lines respectively: 

<pre>
cameraserver cameraserver.cfg
</pre>

<pre>
opencvdemo opencvdemo.cfg
</pre>
