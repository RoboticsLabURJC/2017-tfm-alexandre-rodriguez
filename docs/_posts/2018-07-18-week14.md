title: Week 14 - Net result bug in GUI fixed
---

The GUI in the neural network result was showing the image segmented from the Mask R-CNN along with a bounding box from the tracker sometimes, so this was fixed. The next necessary improvement is to move the buffer to Cam completely without having it in the GUI branch too.

Other future tasks include the incorporation of the DetectionSuite ([https://github.com/JdeRobot/dl-DetectionSuite](https://github.com/JdeRobot/dl-DetectionSuite)) and the ObjectDetector ([https://github.com/JdeRobot/dl-objectdetector](https://github.com/JdeRobot/dl-objectdetector)) components from JdeRobot.
