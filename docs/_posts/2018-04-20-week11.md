title: Week 11 - First prototype of the delay buffer
---

This week I implemented a first prototype of the delay buffer fixing some bugs of the previous version but it still has some little failures pending to be solved. On the other hand, the Docker container has not been configured yet to allow graphic sessions so the works in it are paused at the moment waiting for that. The next steps are going to include to move the buffer to the Cam branch, a circular buffer and an improved visualization (some GUI changes).
