title: Week 23 - Fixing bugs, datasets parsing
---

This week some necessary bugs were fixed. First, the log from the Tensorflow networks are now done fine. In the previous versions only the logging from Keras networks were working. Also, the first and last frames from a local video source are now processed and logged. An initial version of the ground truth converters is available at [https://github.com/RoboticsURJC-students/2017-tfm-alexandre-rodriguez/blob/develop/dl_objecttracker/groundtruths/convert_gt_to_pascalvoc.py](https://github.com/RoboticsURJC-students/2017-tfm-alexandre-rodriguez/blob/develop/dl_objecttracker/groundtruths/convert_gt_to_pascalvoc.py) which includes the OTB and NFS datasets partially parsed. This is because the classes from those datasets does not match always with the classes which the neural network has (COCO, VOC datasets...). So, for the moment this class is hardcoded. For the MOT dataset parsing is necessary to include a mechanism of IDs assignation which is in progress. Also in progress is the ROS image source.
