title: Week 20 - Revisiting the previous work on the project report
---

The work done in Week 4 was reviewed to check the possible updates needed according to the State of the Art. I also had a look over the structure of the final report to continue its writing in parallel with the last changes in the application.

The MOSSE and CSRT tracker could not be tested inside the application due to the actual version available in JdeRobot but a tracker using dlib library is going to be reviewed and hopefully tested ([https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/10/29/multi-object-tracking-with-dlib/](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/10/29/multi-object-tracking-with-dlib/)). dlib is an opensource library containing machine learning algorithms and tools which is commonly used both on industry and academia.
