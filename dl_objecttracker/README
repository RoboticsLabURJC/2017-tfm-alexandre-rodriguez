How to launch the object tracker?

    Terminal: $ python2 objecttracker.py objecttracker.yml

Modify the configuration file (.yml) accordingly.
 - At the moment, the program only supports Tensorflow (Network->Framework). The Keras implementation will be available soon.
 - The source tested by now is a locally saved video (ObjectTracker->Source). Change the video path to your video (Video->Path).
