How to launch the object tracker?

If you want GUI:
    
	$ python2 objecttracker.py objecttracker.yml on

Else, you prefer to save the results as .jpg images:
	
	$ python2 objecttracker.py objecttracker.yml off

Modify the configuration file (.yml) accordingly.
 - At the moment, the program only supports Tensorflow (Network->Framework). The Keras implementation will be available soon.
 - The source tested by now is a locally saved video (ObjectTracker->Source). Change the video path to your video (Video->Path).
