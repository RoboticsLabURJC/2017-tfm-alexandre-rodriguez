How to launch the object tracker?

If you want GUI:
    
	$ python2 objecttracker.py objecttracker.yml on

Else, you prefer to save the results as .jpg images:
	
	$ python2 objecttracker.py objecttracker.yml off

Modify the configuration file (.yml) accordingly.
 - Tensorflow and Keras support (Network->Framework).
 - The available sources are: 
	- a locally saved video (ObjectTracker->Source->Video). Change the video path to your video (Video->Path)
	- local saved images (ObjectTracker->Source->Images). Change the images path (Images->Path)
	- live video from camera using OpenCV (ObjectTracker->Source->Local)
	- ROS stream using usb_cam driver (ObjectTracker->Source->Stream)

To use the ROS stream you need to launch the usb_cam node in another terminal:

	$ roslaunch usb_cam.launch

When using the application with a local video you can now select if you want or not to use the logging option: ObjectTracker->Logger->Status->on/off
