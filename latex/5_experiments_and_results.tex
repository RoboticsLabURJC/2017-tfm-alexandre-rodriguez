The GOTURN (\textit{Generic Object Tracking Using Regression Networks}) is a deep learning based tracking algorithm which learns the motion of the object in an \textit{offline} manner. Many real-time trackers rely on \textit{online} learning that is usually much faster than a deep learning based tracking solution. The authors affirm in the original paper \cite{held2016learning} that they are ``the first neural-network tracker that learns to track generic objects at 100 FPS" (using GPU acceleration, Nvidia GTX 680). However, when using only a CPU the tracker runs at 2,7 FPS according to the authors. This was the main reason to discard this tracker for the project. %ToDo: comentar tests feitos con goturn?
