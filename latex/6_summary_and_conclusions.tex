\section{Future work}
The following are some of the possible future improvements for this work:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Train neural network models used (or not) in multiobject tracking datasets such as MOT. This could lead to better results.
    \item Try weights quantization techniques in neural networks with high number of parameters (region-based, for example).
    \item Refering to the tracking, the multiprocessing with dlib for tracking is available but it was not introduced in the project. This may speed up the tracking with dlib.
    \item Obtain configuration in different way: avoid to use only some sequences, try all combinations?
    \item Improve the metrics calculation: assigning IDs to the tracked objects allowing for the calculation of tracking metrics (MOTA, for example), checking all possible combinations available in the configuration of the project. There exists official Python implementations of metrics for benchmarking MOT such as \href{https://github.com/cheind/py-motmetrics}{\textit{py-motmetrics}} but ID assignation is needed first.
    \item Test the application in other non-GPU devices as Raspberry Pi or Intel Computer Stick... and also in devices with graphic acceleration.
    \item Solve some pending bugs in the GUI?
