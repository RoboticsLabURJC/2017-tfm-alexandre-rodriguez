The Multiple Object Tracking or \textit{MOT} is an important computer vision problem which continues to attract attention because of its potential in both the academic and commercial spheres. The real-world applications of the multiobject tracking are numerous including human-computer interaction, autonomous vehicles, robotics, video indexing, surveillance or security, among others. The computer vision community have been making efforts in the past few decades but the MOT task is still open for improvement. One of the most studied tracking areas is the pedestrian tracking, mainly because the videos of pedestrians can be seen in a large number of applications with commercial potential. As some studies indicate [1], about the 70\% of the current research done in MOT is dedicated to pedestrians. The difficulty of MOT lies in various challenging situations that can occur such as variation of the illumination and the scale, target deformation or fast motion. Most of this challenges are common to Single Object Tracking (\textit{SOT}) but MOT also needs to solve two main tasks: determining the number of objects that usually vary over time and mantaining their identities.
