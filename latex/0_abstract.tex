\chapter*{Abstract}
The visual multiple object tracking is an open problem inside the computer vision community with multiple applications in the industry such as in the autonomous vehicles or in the security field. Many efforts has been made in the past to solve this task, especially for person tracking due to its greater interest.\\
In the last years, the deep learning techniques have been able to beat the state of the art in tasks such as image classification or object detection in images. Thus, this work has made use of deep learning methods to built a visual multiobject tracking application. These techniques are combined with a tracking by detection scheme to perform the tracking and achieve a good balance between speed and accuracy in the tracking. The final developed software component, named as \textit{dl-objecttracker}, has a mechanism of tracking processing speed measurement that allows for different tracking processing speed regimes and it is also configurable.\\
Finally, the developed solution has been experimentally validated on the MOT17Det dataset, one of the most well-known datasets of multiple object tracking (MOT).
